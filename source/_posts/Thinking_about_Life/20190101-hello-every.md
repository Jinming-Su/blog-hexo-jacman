# Why is this blog constructed?
From 2013, I always condier about writing and sharing my learning, thinking and doing in the internet. I have tried many blog platforms and built my blog successively. In the end, I usualy have to stop updating my blog because of I don't have so much time to deal with this time-consuming matter. Today, I rethink about writing daily, which is important for everyone especially students and researchers. We should learn and do the acadamic research work, so we need more accumulation and thinking. So I decide to construct this blog to regularly share my learning,thinking and doing.
